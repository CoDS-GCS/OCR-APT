On April 8, 2022, a series of suspicious activities were logged, indicating potential malicious behavior associated with the process HxTsr. The process exhibited network communication with the external IP address       
13.107.5.88, which is a notable indicator of command and control (C2) activity. The process loaded multiple dynamic link libraries (DLLs), some of which are commonly associated with legitimate Windows operations, but   
their usage in this context raises concerns about exploitation.                                                                                                                                                            

The attack appears to have initiated with the HxTsr process receiving and sending data to the external IP, suggesting a possible data exfiltration or C2 communication. The presence of the WerFault process, which is     
typically used for error reporting, may indicate an attempt to mask malicious activities under the guise of legitimate system operations. The involvement of multiple processes, including chrome, svchost, and taskhostw, 
further complicates the analysis, as these are standard Windows processes that could be exploited for lateral movement or privilege escalation.                                                                            

                                                                                                 Stages of the APT Attack:

 • Lateral Movement: Involvement of multiple processes that could indicate attempts to spread or escalate privileges within the system.

On April 8, 2022, a series of suspicious activities were logged, indicating potential malicious behavior associated with the process HxTsr. This process exhibited network communication with the external IP address      
13.107.5.88, which is a notable indicator of command and control (C2) activity. The attack appears to have initiated with the HxTsr process receiving and sending data to the external IP, suggesting a possible data      
exfiltration or C2 communication.                                                                                                                                                                                          

The HxTsr process loaded multiple dynamic link libraries (DLLs), some of which are commonly associated with legitimate Windows operations, but their usage in this context raises concerns about exploitation. The presence
of the FWPUCLNT.DLL and bcrypt.dll indicates potential privilege escalation and secure communication for malicious purposes. Additionally, the involvement of standard Windows processes such as chrome and svchost        
complicates the analysis, as these could be exploited for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

 • Lateral Movement: Involvement of multiple processes that could indicate attempts to spread or escalate privileges within the system.

The logs indicate a series of communications involving the IP address 13.107.5.88/32 on April 8, 2022, and April 9, 2022. The activity appears to be consistent with the Command and Control stage of an APT attack, where 
the attacker maintains communication with compromised devices.                                                                                                                                                             

Key events include:                                                                                                                                                                                                        

 • April 8, 2022: Multiple instances of data being received and sent between the HxTsr process and the IP address, indicating potential command and control communications.                                                
 • April 8, 2022: The YourPhone and Microsoft.Photos applications also show similar patterns of receiving and sending data to the same IP address, suggesting that these applications may be involved in the attack or are 
   being exploited.                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 • April 9, 2022: Continued communication with the same IP address, indicating persistence and potential data exfiltration attempts.                                                                                       

The consistent interaction with the IP address over multiple hours suggests that the attacker may be attempting to maintain a foothold within the network and possibly exfiltrate data.

                                                                                                Summary of Attack Behavior                                                                                                 

On April 8, 2022, a series of suspicious activities were logged, indicating potential malicious behavior associated with the process HxTsr. This process exhibited network communication with the external IP address      
13.107.5.88, which is a notable indicator of command and control (C2) activity. The attack appears to have initiated with the HxTsr process receiving and sending data to the external IP, suggesting a possible data      
exfiltration or C2 communication.                                                                                                                                                                                          

The HxTsr process loaded multiple dynamic link libraries (DLLs), some of which are commonly associated with legitimate Windows operations, but their usage in this context raises concerns about exploitation. The presence
of the FWPUCLNT.DLL and bcrypt.dll indicates potential privilege escalation and secure communication for malicious purposes. Additionally, the involvement of standard Windows processes such as chrome and svchost        
complicates the analysis, as these could be exploited for lateral movement or privilege escalation.                                                                                                                        

                                                                                                 Stages of the APT Attack:                                                                                                 

 • Command and Control: Communication with the external IP 13.107.5.88.                                                                                                                                                    
 • Privilege Escalation: Loading of various DLLs, including ntdll.dll, which is critical for system operations.                                                                                                            
 • Lateral Movement: Involvement of multiple processes that could indicate attempts to spread or escalate privileges within the system.                                                                                    
 • Data Exfiltration: The communication with 13.107.5.88 and the loading of msxml6.dll suggest attempts to exfiltrate data.

                                                                                                Summary of Attack Behavior                                                                                                 

On April 8, 2022, a series of log events were recorded indicating potential malicious activity associated with an advanced persistent threat (APT). The attack behavior can be summarized as follows:                      

 1 Initial Compromise: The attacker initiated the connection by sending data to the external IP address 13.107.5.88/32. This action suggests an attempt to establish a foothold in the target environment.                 
 2 Command and Control: The attacker established a command and control channel with the IP address 52.98.75.82/32, evidenced by multiple send and receive actions. This indicates that the attacker was likely             
   communicating with a remote server to receive commands or exfiltrate data.                                                                                                                                              
 3 Maintain Persistence: The file HxStore.hxd was written multiple times, suggesting that the attacker may be attempting to maintain persistence within the environment by ensuring that necessary components remain       
   available for future access.                                                                                                                                                                                            

The logs indicate a structured approach to the attack, with clear stages of compromise, control, and persistence.

                                                                                                Summary of Attack Behavior                                                                                                 

On April 8, 2022, a series of suspicious activities were logged, indicating potential malicious behavior associated with the process HxTsr. This process exhibited network communication with the external IP address      
13.107.5.88, which is a notable indicator of command and control (C2) activity. The attack appears to have initiated with the HxTsr process receiving and sending data to the external IP, suggesting a possible data      
exfiltration or C2 communication.                                                                                                                                                                                          

The HxTsr process loaded multiple dynamic link libraries (DLLs), some of which are commonly associated with legitimate Windows operations, but their usage in this context raises concerns about exploitation. The presence
of the FWPUCLNT.DLL and bcrypt.dll indicates potential privilege escalation and secure communication for malicious purposes. Additionally, the involvement of standard Windows processes such as chrome and svchost        
complicates the analysis, as these could be exploited for lateral movement or privilege escalation.                                                                                                                        

                                                                                                 Stages of the APT Attack:                                                                                                 

 • Command and Control: Communication with the external IP 13.107.5.88.                                                                                                                                                    
 • Privilege Escalation: Loading of various DLLs, including ntdll.dll, which is critical for system operations.                                                                                                            
 • Lateral Movement: Involvement of multiple processes that could indicate attempts to spread or escalate privileges within the system.                                                                                    
 • Data Exfiltration: The communication with 13.107.5.88 and the loading of msxml6.dll suggest attempts to exfiltrate data.

The logs from the document indicate a series of actions primarily involving the executable file HxTsr.exe and its associated prefetch file HXTSR.EXE-A364904B.pf. The activity appears to be consistent with the stages of 
an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack, particularly focusing on the Initial Compromise, Internal Reconnaissance, and Maintain Persistence stages.                                                                     

 1 Initial Compromise: The execution of HxTsr.exe at 13:00 on April 8, 2022, marks the beginning of the attack. This executable is likely a legitimate application, but its usage in this context raises suspicion.        
 2 Internal Reconnaissance: The subsequent reads of the prefetch file HXTSR.EXE-A364904B.pf at 13:35 and 18:30 suggest that the attacker is gathering information about the execution of the HxTsr.exe process, which could
   be indicative of reconnaissance activities within the compromised environment.                                                                                                                                          
 3 Maintain Persistence: The repeated writes to the prefetch file throughout the day indicate an effort to maintain persistence, ensuring that the malicious executable can be executed again without detection.           

Overall, the logs reflect a methodical approach to establishing a foothold within the system, with a focus on maintaining access and gathering information.

                                                                                                Summary of Attack Behavior                                                                                                 

On April 8, 2022, a series of suspicious activities were logged, indicating potential malicious behavior associated with the process HxTsr. This process exhibited network communication with the external IP address      
13.107.5.88, which is a notable indicator of command and control (C2) activity. The attack appears to have initiated with the HxTsr process receiving and sending data to the external IP, suggesting a possible data      
exfiltration or C2 communication.                                                                                                                                                                                          

The HxTsr process loaded multiple dynamic link libraries (DLLs), some of which are commonly associated with legitimate Windows operations, but their usage in this context raises concerns about exploitation. The presence
of the FWPUCLNT.DLL and bcrypt.dll indicates potential privilege escalation and secure communication for malicious purposes. Additionally, the involvement of standard Windows processes such as chrome and svchost        
complicates the analysis, as these could be exploited for lateral movement or privilege escalation.                                                                                                                        

                                                                                                 Stages of the APT Attack:                                                                                                 

 • Command and Control: Communication with the external IP 13.107.5.88.                                                                                                                                                    
 • Privilege Escalation: Loading of various DLLs, including ntdll.dll, which is critical for system operations.                                                                                                            
 • Lateral Movement: Involvement of multiple processes that could indicate attempts to spread or escalate privileges within the system.                                                                                    
 • Data Exfiltration: The communication with 13.107.5.88 and the loading of msxml6.dll suggest attempts to exfiltrate data.

The logs from the document indicate a series of events involving the loading of the file FWPUCLNT.DLL across various processes, primarily on April 8th and 9th, 2022. The repeated loading of this DLL file suggests       
potential malicious activity, particularly in the context of maintaining persistence within the system.

 • Initial Compromise: The first instance of FWPUCLNT.DLL being loaded occurred on April 8, 2022, at 18:30 by the HxTsr process. This could indicate the initial compromise stage where the attacker gains access to the   
   system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 • Maintain Persistence: The DLL was loaded multiple times by various processes, including msedge, chrome, and svchost, indicating an effort to maintain persistence within the system. The frequent loading of this file  
   suggests that it may be used to ensure continued access or control over the compromised environment.

On April 8, 2022, a series of suspicious activities were logged, indicating potential malicious behavior associated with the process HxTsr. This process exhibited network communication with the external IP address      
13.107.5.88, which is a notable indicator of command and control (C2) activity. The attack appears to have initiated with the HxTsr process receiving and sending data to the external IP, suggesting a possible data      
exfiltration or C2 communication.                                                                                                                                                                                          

The HxTsr process loaded multiple dynamic link libraries (DLLs), some of which are commonly associated with legitimate Windows operations, but their usage in this context raises concerns about exploitation. The presence
of the FWPUCLNT.DLL and bcrypt.dll indicates potential privilege escalation and secure communication for malicious purposes. Additionally, the involvement of standard Windows processes such as chrome and svchost        
complicates the analysis, as these could be exploited for lateral movement or privilege escalation.                                                                                                                        

                                                                                                 Stages of the APT Attack:

This report highlights the critical indicators of compromise and the suspicious activities associated with the HxTsr process, emphasizing the need for further investigation and remediation to mitigate potential threats.
The presence of multiple DLLs and the involvement of standard processes suggest a sophisticated attack that requires immediate attention.                                                                                  

                                                                                       Additional Context from context_file_fwpuclnt
