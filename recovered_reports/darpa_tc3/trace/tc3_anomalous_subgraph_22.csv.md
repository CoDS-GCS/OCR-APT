# Attack Report: tc3_anomalous_subgraph_22.csv

## Summary of Attack Behavior

On April 13, 2018, the Thunderbird application exhibited a series of anomalous behaviors that suggest potential malicious activity. The logs indicate multiple instances of memory protection and file renaming, which are often associated with attempts to manipulate or hide malicious actions. 

Key events include:
- **Memory Protection (MPROTECT)**: The Thunderbird process invoked memory protection three times at 14:13, followed by two additional instances at 14:14. This behavior may indicate an attempt to secure memory regions, possibly to prevent detection or modification of sensitive data.
- **File Renaming**: The process renamed several files, including "aborted-session-ping" and "store.json.mozlz4," multiple times between 14:14 and 14:33. Frequent renaming of files can be indicative of an attempt to obscure malicious activity or to manage session data in a way that avoids detection.
- **File Unlinking**: The final action recorded was the unlinking of the "aborted-session-ping" file at 14:33, which could signify an effort to erase traces of the session or to cover tracks after potential data manipulation.

These actions suggest a possible **Covering Tracks** stage of an APT attack, where the attacker seeks to eliminate evidence of their presence and activities.

## Table of IoCs Detected

| IoC                     | Security Context                                                                                     |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| aborted-session-ping    | A legitimate file used by Thunderbird to manage session data. Frequent renaming may indicate obfuscation. |
| store.json.mozlz4      | A legitimate file that stores user data for Thunderbird. Its manipulation could suggest data tampering.   |
| thunderbird             | The application itself, which is legitimate but may be exploited for malicious purposes if compromised.   |
