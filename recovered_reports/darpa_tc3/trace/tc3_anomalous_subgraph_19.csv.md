## Summary of Attack Behavior

On April 13, 2018, the process `thunderbird` exhibited a series of anomalous behaviors that suggest potential malicious activity. The timeline of events indicates that the process engaged in memory mapping and protection operations, followed by file renaming and unlinking actions. 

- **13:40**: The `thunderbird` process performed memory mapping (MMAP) and memory protection (MPROTECT) operations twice, indicating potential manipulation of memory regions, which could be a precursor to exploitation.
- **13:40**: The process renamed a file, which may suggest an attempt to obscure its activities or modify its operational context.
- **13:41**: The process executed additional memory protection operations and memory mapping, followed by an exit command, indicating a possible cleanup or termination of the malicious activity.
- **13:41**: The process renamed the file `aborted-session-ping` and subsequently unlinked it, which could imply an attempt to delete evidence of its actions.

These actions align with the **Covering Tracks** stage of an APT attack, where the attacker seeks to erase or modify logs and files to avoid detection.

## Table of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

| IoC                     | Security Context                                                                                     |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| thunderbird             | A legitimate email client. However, its processes can be exploited for malicious activities, such as data exfiltration or unauthorized access. |
| aborted-session-ping    | A file associated with `thunderbird`. Its renaming and unlinking suggest potential malicious intent to hide or remove traces of activity. |

## Chronological Log of Actions

|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 13:40  | `thunderbird MMAP a memory` (2 times)                                                    |
| 13:40  | `thunderbird MPROTECT a memory` (2 times)                                                |
| 13:40  | `thunderbird RENAME a file`                                                               |
| 13:41  | `thunderbird MPROTECT a memory` (3 times)                                                |
| 13:41  | `thunderbird MMAP a memory` (2 times)                                                    |
| 13:41  | `thunderbird EXIT the process: thunderbird`                                               |
| 13:41  | `thunderbird RENAME a file`                                                               |
| 13:41  | `thunderbird RENAME the file: aborted-session-ping`                                      |
| 13:41  | `thunderbird UNLINK the file: aborted-session-ping`                                       |

This report highlights the suspicious behavior of the `thunderbird` process and the potential implications of the detected IoCs, warranting further investigation into the incident.
