# Attack Report: tc3_anomalous_subgraph_0.csv

## Summary of Attack Behavior

The logs from the document indicate a series of suspicious activities that suggest a potential Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack. The timeline begins with the execution of the process `tcexec`, which includes memory allocation, library loading, and file writing operations. 

Key events include:

- **Initial Compromise**: The process `tcexec` was executed, indicating the start of the attack.
- **Command and Control**: Multiple connections were established to various external IP addresses (e.g., 128.55.12.55, 128.55.12.67) and subsequently closed, suggesting attempts to communicate with a command and control server.
- **Data Exfiltration**: The process involved writing files multiple times, which could indicate data being exfiltrated.
- **Covering Tracks**: The closing of various flows and pipes suggests an effort to hide the attacker's presence.

The attack culminated with the exit of the `tcexec` process, indicating the end of the observed malicious activity.

## Table of IoCs Detected

| IoC                | Security Context                                                                                     |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 128.55.12.1        | Potentially a command and control server; legitimate usage may include internal network services.   |
| 128.55.12.55       | External IP address involved in multiple connections; high likelihood of exploitation.              |
| 128.55.12.67       | External IP address with multiple connection attempts; could be associated with malicious activity. |
| 128.55.12.73       | External IP address involved in data transfer; potential command and control server.                |
| 128.55.12.103      | External IP address with connections; may indicate lateral movement or data exfiltration.          |
| 128.55.12.110      | External IP address involved in connections; potential for exploitation.                           |
| 128.55.12.141      | External IP address with multiple connection attempts; could indicate malicious intent.             |
| 128.55.12.166      | External IP address involved in connections; potential command and control server.                  |
| 103.12.253.24      | External IP address with a connection; may indicate an external threat actor's involvement.        |
