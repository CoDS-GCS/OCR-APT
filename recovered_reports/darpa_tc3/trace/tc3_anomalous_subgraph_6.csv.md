# Attack Report: tc3_anomalous_subgraph_6.csv

## Summary of Attack Behavior

The logs from the document indicate a series of network connection and disconnection events involving multiple IP addresses on April 13, 2018. The behavior suggests a potential APT attack characterized by rapid connection and disconnection of flows, which may indicate reconnaissance or lateral movement activities. 

Key events include:
- **14:21**: Multiple connections and closures of flows involving IP addresses 128.55.12.73 and 128.55.12.55, indicating possible initial reconnaissance or lateral movement.
- **14:22**: Repeated connections and closures of the flow for IP address 128.55.12.67, suggesting an attempt to establish a foothold or maintain persistence.
- **14:23**: A series of closures followed by immediate reconnections for several IP addresses, indicating a potential attempt to regain access or maintain control over the network.
- **14:26**: The flow for IP address 128.55.12.1 was closed and then immediately reconnected, which may indicate an effort to evade detection or maintain persistence.
- **14:28**: The process `tcexec` exited, which could signify the end of the attack session or a temporary withdrawal.

This sequence of events aligns with the **Internal Reconnaissance** and **Lateral Movement** stages of an APT attack.

## Table of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

| IoC                | Security Context                                                                                     |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 128.55.12.73       | Potentially involved in reconnaissance or lateral movement; legitimate usage in network operations. |
| 128.55.12.55       | Frequently connected and closed; could indicate exploitation attempts or unauthorized access.       |
| 128.55.12.67       | Repeated connections suggest a focus on this IP; may be a target for lateral movement.             |
| 128.55.12.166      | Engaged in connection and closure events; requires further investigation for potential threats.     |
| 128.55.12.1        | Closed and reconnected quickly; may indicate attempts to maintain persistence or evade detection.   |
| 128.55.12.103      | Similar behavior as above; warrants monitoring for unusual activity.                               |
| 128.55.12.110      | Engaged in multiple connection events; potential for exploitation or unauthorized access.           |
| 128.55.12.141      | Involved in connection events; should be analyzed for any malicious activity.                      |
