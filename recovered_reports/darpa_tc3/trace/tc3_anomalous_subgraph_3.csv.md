# Attack Report: tc3_anomalous_subgraph_3.csv

## Summary of Attack Behavior

The logs indicate a series of network connection and disconnection events involving multiple IP addresses on April 13, 2018. The activity appears to be part of a coordinated effort to establish and terminate connections, which is characteristic of the **Command and Control** stage of an APT attack. 

Key events include:
- Multiple connections and closures of flows at the same timestamp, suggesting potential lateral movement or reconnaissance activities.
- The process `tcexec` was used to manage these connections, indicating a possible exploitation of this executable for malicious purposes.
- The exit of the `tcexec` process at 14:28 could signify the end of the attack or a transition to another phase.

## Table of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

| IoC                | Security Context                                                                                     |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 128.55.12.73       | An IP address involved in both connection and closure events. Potentially exploited for lateral movement. |
| 128.55.12.55       | Frequently connected and closed, indicating possible command and control activity.                     |
| 128.55.12.67       | Engaged in multiple connection and closure events, suggesting it may be a target or a compromised host. |
| 128.55.12.166      | Similar to others, involved in connection and closure events, indicating potential exploitation.       |
| 128.55.12.1        | Connected and closed multiple times, possibly indicating a key asset in the attack.                   |
| 128.55.12.103      | Engaged in connection and closure events, may represent a compromised system or a target.             |
| 128.55.12.110      | Involved in multiple connection events, indicating potential exploitation or reconnaissance.           |
| 128.55.12.141      | Similar to others, engaged in connection and closure events, suggesting possible exploitation.         |
