# Attack Report: tc3_anomalous_subgraph_11.csv

## Summary of Attack Behavior

The logs from the document indicate a series of network connection and disconnection events involving multiple external IP addresses on April 13, 2018. The sequence of actions suggests a potential APT attack characterized by rapid connection and disconnection of flows, which may indicate reconnaissance or lateral movement activities. 

Key events include:
- **14:20**: The process `tcexec` closed a pipe, possibly indicating the end of a previous session or connection.
- **14:21**: Multiple connections and closures of flows occurred, particularly with IP addresses `128.55.12.73` and `128.55.12.55`, suggesting an attempt to establish control over these connections.
- **14:22**: The flow `128.55.12.67` was closed and then immediately reconnected, indicating a potential attempt to maintain persistence or evade detection.
- **14:23**: A series of closures and reconnections of multiple flows occurred, which may indicate lateral movement within the network.
- **14:26**: The flow `128.55.12.1` was closed and then immediately reconnected, further supporting the notion of maintaining persistence.
- **14:28**: The process `tcexec` exited, which may indicate the end of the attack session.

This behavior aligns with the **Internal Reconnaissance** and **Lateral Movement** stages of an APT attack, where the attacker seeks to explore the network and establish control over various systems.

## Table of IoCs Detected

| IoC                | Security Context                                                                                     |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 128.55.12.73       | External IP address involved in multiple connection attempts; potential command and control server. |
| 128.55.12.55       | Frequently connected and closed; could indicate a compromised host or a target for lateral movement. |
| 128.55.12.67       | Rapid connection and disconnection suggest potential exploitation or evasion tactics.               |
| 128.55.12.166      | Connected during the incident; further investigation needed to determine legitimacy.                |
| 128.55.12.1        | Involved in multiple connection attempts; may indicate a critical asset or target for exploitation.  |
| 128.55.12.103      | Connected and closed multiple times; potential for being a compromised system.                      |
| 128.55.12.110      | Similar behavior as above; requires further analysis to assess risk.                                |
| 128.55.12.141      | Engaged in connection attempts; could be part of a larger network of compromised systems.           |
