# Attack Report: Context File Analysis (ld-linux-x86-64)

## Summary of Attack Behavior

The logs from the document indicate a series of events involving the loading of the library file `ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`. This file is a critical component of the Linux operating system, responsible for dynamic linking. The repeated loading of this library by various applications, including Thunderbird and Python3, suggests potential malicious activity, particularly in the context of an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack.

### Key Events:
- **Initial Compromise**: The first instance of loading the library occurred on **2018-04-13 at 13:59** by Thunderbird, indicating the potential entry point of the attack.
- **Subsequent Loads**: The library was loaded multiple times by different processes, including Python3 and tcexec, suggesting that the attacker may be attempting to establish a foothold or execute further commands.
- The timestamps indicate a pattern of activity that could be indicative of reconnaissance or exploitation attempts.
