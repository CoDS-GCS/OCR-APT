# Attack Report: tc3_anomalous_subgraph_9.csv

## Summary of Attack Behavior

The logs from the document indicate a series of network connection and disconnection events involving multiple IP addresses on April 13, 2018. The activity appears to be part of a coordinated effort to establish and terminate connections, which is characteristic of the **Command and Control** stage of an APT attack. 

Key events include:
- Multiple connections and closures of flows at the same timestamp, suggesting potential lateral movement or reconnaissance activities.
- The process `tcexec` was observed connecting and closing flows to various IP addresses, indicating possible attempts to establish a foothold or communicate with compromised systems.
- The exit of the `tcexec` process at 14:28 could signify the end of the session or an attempt to cover tracks.

The sequence of events suggests a methodical approach to network manipulation, which is often indicative of APT behavior.

## Table of IoCs Detected

| IoC                | Security Context                                                                                     |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 128.55.12.73       | Potentially malicious IP; could be used for command and control or data exfiltration.              |
| 128.55.12.55       | Frequently connected and closed; may indicate a compromised host or a staging server.              |
| 128.55.12.67       | Repeated connections suggest it may be a target for lateral movement or data gathering.             |
| 128.55.12.166      | Involved in both connection and closure events; could be a command and control server.              |
| 128.55.12.1        | Active in multiple connection events; may indicate a critical node in the attack infrastructure.    |
| 128.55.12.103      | Engaged in connection events; potential for exploitation or data exfiltration.                     |
| 128.55.12.110      | Similar to other IoCs; could be part of a larger network of compromised systems.                   |
| 128.55.12.141      | Involved in both connection and closure; may indicate a compromised endpoint or service.            |
