# Attack Report: tc3_anomalous_subgraph_20.csv

## Summary of Attack Behavior

The logs from the document indicate a series of suspicious activities performed by the process `thunderbird` on April 13, 2018. The behavior suggests potential malicious activity, particularly around the time of 14:01, where multiple file operations, including renaming and unlinking files, were executed. 

Key events include:
- **Initial Compromise**: The process `thunderbird` appears to have been compromised, as indicated by the frequent file operations and memory manipulations.
- **Internal Reconnaissance**: The process opened and read various files, including `prefs-1.js`, `mailcap`, and `watch`, which may indicate an attempt to gather information about the system's configuration and user preferences.
- **Command and Control**: The repeated use of `RECVMSG` and `SENDMSG` suggests potential communication with a command and control server.
- **Privilege Escalation**: The `MPROTECT` and `MMAP` actions indicate attempts to manipulate memory, which could be indicative of privilege escalation techniques.
- **Data Exfiltration**: The creation and modification of files like `recently-used.xbel` and `tcexec` may suggest attempts to exfiltrate or manipulate sensitive data.
- **Covering Tracks**: The unlinking of the file `aborted-session-ping` and renaming of files could be efforts to erase traces of the attack.

## Table of IoCs Detected

| IoC                        | Security Context                                                                                     |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 127.0.1.1:+26265          | A local IP address, potentially used for internal communication. Low likelihood of exploitation.   |
| prefs-1.js                | A configuration file for user preferences. Legitimate usage, but could be exploited to alter settings. |
| tcexec                    | A file that may be related to execution commands. Legitimate usage, but could be a target for exploitation. |
| recently-used.xbel        | A file that tracks recently used applications. Legitimate usage, but could be exploited for user activity tracking. |
| aborted-session-ping      | A file that may be related to session management. Legitimate usage, but its deletion may indicate covering tracks. |
| mailcap                   | A file that defines how to handle different file types. Legitimate usage, but could be exploited to execute malicious files. |
| watch                     | A file that may be related to monitoring or logging. Legitimate usage, but could be exploited for surveillance. |
