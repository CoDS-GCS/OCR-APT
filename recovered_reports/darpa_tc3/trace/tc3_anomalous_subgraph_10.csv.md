# Attack Report: tc3_anomalous_subgraph_10.csv

## Summary of Attack Behavior

The logs from the document indicate a series of network connection and disconnection events involving multiple IP addresses on April 13, 2018. The behavior observed suggests a potential APT attack characterized by rapid connection and disconnection of flows, which may indicate reconnaissance or lateral movement activities. 

Key events include:
- **14:21**: Initial connections were established for IPs `128.55.12.55` and `128.55.12.73`, followed by their immediate closure.
- **14:22**: Multiple connections and closures occurred for IPs `128.55.12.67` and `128.55.12.166`, indicating possible attempts to establish a foothold or gather information.
- **14:23**: A series of connections were made for several IPs, including `128.55.12.1`, `128.55.12.103`, `128.55.12.110`, and `128.55.12.141`, suggesting lateral movement within the network.
- **14:26**: The process `tcexec` closed and reopened connections for `128.55.12.1`, indicating potential persistence attempts.
- **14:28**: The process `tcexec` exited, which may suggest the end of the attack or a temporary halt.

This sequence of events aligns with the **Internal Reconnaissance** and **Lateral Movement** stages of an APT attack, where the attacker seeks to explore the network and establish connections to other systems.

## Table of IoCs Detected

| IoC               | Security Context                                                                 |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 128.55.12.55      | Commonly used IP; legitimate usage possible, but frequent connections may indicate exploitation. |
| 128.55.12.73      | Commonly used IP; legitimate usage possible, but rapid connection/disconnection raises suspicion. |
| 128.55.12.67      | Commonly used IP; legitimate usage possible, but multiple connections suggest potential exploitation. |
| 128.55.12.166     | Commonly used IP; legitimate usage possible, but connection patterns may indicate malicious activity. |
| 128.55.12.1       | Commonly used IP; legitimate usage possible, but frequent connections may indicate exploitation. |
| 128.55.12.103     | Commonly used IP; legitimate usage possible, but rapid connection/disconnection raises suspicion. |
| 128.55.12.110     | Commonly used IP; legitimate usage possible, but multiple connections suggest potential exploitation. |
| 128.55.12.141     | Commonly used IP; legitimate usage possible, but connection patterns may indicate malicious activity. |
