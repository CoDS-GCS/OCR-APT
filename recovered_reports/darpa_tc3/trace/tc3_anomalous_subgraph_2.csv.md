## Summary of Attack Behavior

The logs from the document indicate a series of network connection and disconnection events involving multiple IP addresses on April 13, 2018. The activity appears to be orchestrated by the process `tcexec`, which executed a sequence of `CONNECT` and `CLOSE` commands. 

Key events include:
- Multiple connections and disconnections to various IP addresses within a short time frame, suggesting potential lateral movement and reconnaissance activities.
- The process `tcexec` connected to and closed connections with several IPs, indicating a possible attempt to establish command and control (C2) channels or to probe the network for vulnerabilities.
- The exit of the `tcexec` process at 14:28 could signify the end of the observed activity, potentially indicating the completion of the attack phase or a temporary halt.

This behavior aligns with the **Internal Reconnaissance** and **Command and Control** stages of an APT attack, where the attacker seeks to gather information about the network and establish control over compromised systems.

## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

| IoC                | Security Context                                                                                     |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 128.55.12.73       | Potentially malicious IP; could be used for C2 communications. Legitimate usage is possible, but exploitation likelihood is moderate. |
| 128.55.12.55       | Another IP involved in multiple connections; may indicate a compromised host. Legitimate usage exists, but exploitation likelihood is moderate to high. |
| 128.55.12.67       | Frequently connected and closed; could be a target for lateral movement. Legitimate usage is possible, but exploitation likelihood is moderate. |
| 128.55.12.166      | Engaged in connection events; may be part of a larger attack infrastructure. Legitimate usage is possible, but exploitation likelihood is moderate. |
| 128.55.12.1        | Involved in multiple connection events; could indicate a compromised system. Legitimate usage exists, but exploitation likelihood is moderate to high. |
| 128.55.12.103      | Connected and closed multiple times; may indicate probing or exploitation attempts. Legitimate usage is possible, but exploitation likelihood is moderate. |
| 128.55.12.110      | Engaged in connection events; could be a target for lateral movement. Legitimate usage exists, but exploitation likelihood is moderate. |
| 128.55.12.141      | Involved in multiple connection events; may indicate a compromised host. Legitimate usage is possible, but exploitation likelihood is moderate to high. |
