# Attack Report: tc3_anomalous_subgraph_21.csv

## Summary of Attack Behavior

On April 13, 2018, the Thunderbird application exhibited a series of anomalous behaviors that suggest potential malicious activity. The logs indicate multiple memory protection and file renaming actions, which are often associated with attempts to manipulate or hide malicious activity. 

Key events include:
- **Memory Protection (MPROTECT)**: The Thunderbird process executed memory protection three times at 14:38 and once at 14:39. This could indicate an attempt to secure malicious code in memory from being altered or detected.
- **File Renaming**: Several files, including `xulstore.json`, `aborted-session-ping`, `session-state.json`, `session.json`, and `sessionCheckpoints.json`, were renamed at 14:39. Renaming files is a common tactic used to obfuscate malicious activity or to prevent detection by security tools.
- **File Unlinking**: The `aborted-session-ping` file was unlinked (deleted) at 14:39, which may indicate an effort to cover tracks after executing potentially harmful actions.

These actions suggest that the attack may fall under the **Covering Tracks** stage of the APT lifecycle, as the attacker appears to be attempting to hide their presence and maintain persistence within the system.

## Table of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

| IoC                        | Security Context                                                                                     |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| thunderbird                | A legitimate email client; however, its processes can be exploited for malicious activities.       |
| xulstore.json             | A configuration file used by Thunderbird; renaming or tampering with it may indicate malicious intent. |
| aborted-session-ping       | A temporary file that may contain session data; its deletion could signify an attempt to erase traces of activity. |
| session-state.json         | Stores the state of the Thunderbird session; manipulation may indicate unauthorized access.        |
| session.json               | Contains session information; renaming could be an attempt to obfuscate malicious actions.        |
| sessionCheckpoints.json    | Used for session recovery; tampering with this file may indicate an effort to disrupt normal operations. |
