# Attack Report: tc3_anomalous_subgraph_4.csv

## Summary of Attack Behavior

The logs from the document indicate a series of network connection and disconnection events involving multiple IP addresses on April 13, 2018. The behavior observed suggests a potential APT attack characterized by rapid connection and disconnection of flows, which may indicate reconnaissance or lateral movement activities. 

Key events include:
- **14:21**: Multiple connections and closures of flows involving IP addresses 128.55.12.73 and 128.55.12.55, indicating possible initial reconnaissance or lateral movement.
- **14:22**: Repeated connections and closures of the flow for IP address 128.55.12.67, suggesting an attempt to establish a foothold or maintain persistence.
- **14:23**: A series of closures followed by reconnections for several IP addresses, indicating a potential attempt to regain access or manipulate the network environment.
- **14:26**: The flow for IP address 128.55.12.1 was closed and then immediately reconnected, which may suggest an effort to maintain persistence.
- **14:28**: The process `tcexec` exited, which could indicate the end of the attack session or a temporary halt in activities.

This sequence of events aligns with the **Internal Reconnaissance** and **Lateral Movement** stages of an APT attack, where the attacker is probing the network and attempting to establish control over multiple systems.

## Table of IoCs Detected

| IoC                | Security Context                                                                                     |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 128.55.12.73       | An IP address involved in multiple connection events; could be a legitimate host or a compromised system. |
| 128.55.12.55       | Frequently connected and closed; potential for exploitation if compromised.                        |
| 128.55.12.67       | Repeated connection attempts suggest it may be a target for lateral movement or persistence.       |
| 128.55.12.166      | Engaged in connection and closure events; requires further investigation for potential threats.    |
| 128.55.12.1        | Involved in connection and disconnection; may indicate a critical system or a compromised endpoint. |
| 128.55.12.103      | Active in the logs; potential for exploitation if part of a compromised network.                   |
| 128.55.12.110      | Engaged in multiple connection events; warrants scrutiny for potential malicious activity.         |
| 128.55.12.141      | Involved in connection events; could be a legitimate service or a target for exploitation.        |
