# Attack Report: Context of tcexec Logs

## Summary of Attack Behavior

The logs from the `context_tcexec` document indicate a series of network communications and library interactions that suggest a potential Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) operation. The attack appears to have initiated with the loading of critical libraries and the establishment of connections to external IP addresses, particularly `162.66.239.75`, which is indicative of Command and Control (C2) activity.

### Key Events:
- **Initial Compromise**: The logs show the loading of system libraries such as `ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`, `libc.so.6`, and `libpthread.so.0`, which are essential for executing processes on Linux systems. This could indicate an attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in these libraries.
- **Command and Control**: The consistent communication with the IP address `162.66.239.75` through multiple `SENDMSG` and `RECVMSG` actions suggests that this IP is being used for C2 purposes, allowing the attacker to maintain control over the compromised system.
- **Internal Reconnaissance**: The logs reveal multiple connections to various internal IP addresses, indicating an exploration of the network environment, which is typical during the reconnaissance phase of an APT.
- **Data Exfiltration and Covering Tracks**: While there are no explicit indicators of data exfiltration or covering tracks in the logs, the repeated connections and disconnections to various IPs could suggest attempts to obfuscate the attacker's presence.

## Table of IoCs Detected

| IoC                     | Security Context                                                                                     |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 162.66.239.75          | Known external IP address associated with C2 activities. High likelihood of exploitation.          |
| ld-linux-x86-64.so.2   | A critical system library; legitimate usage but can be exploited if compromised.                   |
| libc.so.6              | Standard C library; essential for many applications. Exploitation can lead to privilege escalation.|
| libpthread.so.0        | Library for multi-threading; legitimate but can be targeted for exploitation.                      |
| ld.so.cache             | Cache for dynamic linker; legitimate usage but can be manipulated for malicious purposes.          |
| 128.55.12.55           | Internal IP address; potential target for lateral movement.                                        |
| 128.55.12.73           | Internal IP address; potential target for lateral movement.                                        |
| 128.55.12.67           | Internal IP address; potential target for lateral movement.                                        |
| 128.55.12.166          | Internal IP address; potential target for lateral movement.                                        |
| 128.55.12.110          | Internal IP address; potential target for lateral movement.                                        |
| 128.55.12.141          | Internal IP address; potential target for lateral movement.                                        |
| 128.55.12.1            | Internal IP address; potential target for lateral movement.                                        |
| 128.55.12.103          | Internal IP address; potential target for lateral movement.                                        |
| 103.12.253.24          | External IP address; potential target for data exfiltration or C2.                                |
