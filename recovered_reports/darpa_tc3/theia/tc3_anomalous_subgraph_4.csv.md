# Attack Report: Anomalous Activity Detected in tc3_anomalous_subgraph_4.csv

## Summary of Attack Behavior

The logs from the document indicate a series of anomalous connection attempts related to a mail service on April 12, 2018. The activity appears to escalate in frequency and intensity, suggesting a potential Command and Control (C2) stage of an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack. 

- **13:18**: The process initiated a connection flow, occurring twice, which may indicate an initial probing or reconnaissance activity.
- **13:19**: The connection attempts increased to six times, suggesting a heightened interest or an attempt to establish a more stable connection.
- **13:20**: The connection attempts peaked at ten times, followed by a specific connection to the external IP address `128.55.12.110`, indicating a potential C2 server interaction.
- **13:21**: The process continued with four additional connection attempts, further solidifying the suspicion of ongoing malicious activity.

This pattern of escalating connection attempts, particularly the direct connection to an external IP, raises concerns about the potential for data exfiltration or further exploitation.

## Table of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

| IoC                | Security Context                                                                                     |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 128.55.12.110      | This external IP address may be associated with malicious activity. It could represent a C2 server used by attackers to control compromised systems. Legitimate usage is possible, but the frequency and context of the connections suggest a high likelihood of exploitation. |
