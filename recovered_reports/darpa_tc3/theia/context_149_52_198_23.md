# Attack Report: Context 149.52.198.23

## Summary of Attack Behavior

The logs indicate a series of email communications involving the IP address **149.52.198.23** on April 12, 2018. The activity appears to be concentrated around the same time frame, suggesting a potential coordinated attack. The following key events were observed:

- **Initial Compromise**: The connection to the IP address was established at **13:17**, with both sending and receiving emails occurring immediately.
- **Internal Reconnaissance**: The frequency of email exchanges increased significantly, with multiple send and receive actions noted at **13:18** and **13:19**. This suggests that the attacker may have been gathering information or probing the network.
- **Command and Control**: The sustained communication with the IP address, particularly the high volume of messages sent and received at **13:20**, indicates a potential command and control operation, where the attacker may be issuing commands or exfiltrating data.
- **Data Exfiltration**: The consistent communication patterns, especially at **13:20**, could imply that data was being exfiltrated, although no specific data transfer logs are present.
- **Covering Tracks**: There are no explicit logs indicating attempts to cover tracks, but the high volume of communication could suggest an effort to obfuscate malicious activities.
