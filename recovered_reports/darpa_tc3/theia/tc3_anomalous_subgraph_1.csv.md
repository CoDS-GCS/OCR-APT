# Attack Report: tc3_anomalous_subgraph_1.csv

## Summary of Attack Behavior

The logs from the document indicate a series of suspicious activities associated with the external IP address **149.52.198.23**. The timeline of events suggests a potential APT attack characterized by multiple connections, data transfers, and memory manipulations. 

### Key Events:
- **Initial Compromise**: The attack appears to have initiated with memory mapping (MMAP) and file operations at **13:17** on **2018-04-12**.
- **Command and Control**: The attacker established a connection with the external IP address, sending and receiving data multiple times throughout the incident. Notably, there were several instances of **SENDTO** and **RECVFROM** actions, indicating a potential command and control (C2) channel.
- **Data Exfiltration**: The frequency of data transfers to and from the IP address suggests that data exfiltration may have occurred, particularly during the periods of high activity at **13:19** and **13:20**.
- **Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement**: The use of memory protection (MPROTECT) and multiple connections may indicate attempts to escalate privileges or move laterally within the network.

## Table of IoCs Detected

| IoC               | Security Context                                                                                     |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 149.52.198.23     | An external IP address associated with suspicious activity. Legitimate usage may include normal traffic, but its repeated connections and data transfers raise concerns about potential exploitation and command and control operations. |
