# Attack Report: tc3_anomalous_subgraph_3.csv

## Summary of Attack Behavior

On April 12, 2018, a series of log events were recorded that indicate potential anomalous behavior associated with an advanced persistent threat (APT) attack. The key events include the opening, reading, and closing of the file `ld-elf.so.hints`, as well as the execution of the process `kldstat`. Additionally, there was a write operation to the file `tty`. 

These actions suggest a possible reconnaissance phase where the attacker is gathering information about the system and its configurations. The repeated access to `ld-elf.so.hints`, a file that typically contains hints for the dynamic linker, indicates that the attacker may be attempting to manipulate or exploit the dynamic linking process, which could lead to privilege escalation or lateral movement within the network.

### APT Stage: 
- **Internal Reconnaissance**: The actions taken suggest that the attacker is gathering information about the system.
- **Privilege Escalation**: The manipulation of system files like `ld-elf.so.hints` could indicate attempts to escalate privileges.

## Table of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

| IoC                | Security Context                                                                                     |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ld-elf.so.hints`  | A legitimate file used by the dynamic linker in Unix-like systems. However, unauthorized access may indicate an attempt to manipulate system behavior. High likelihood of exploitation. |
| `kldstat`          | A command used to display the status of loaded kernel modules. While legitimate, its execution in conjunction with suspicious file access raises concerns about potential exploitation. Moderate likelihood of exploitation. |
| `tty`              | A terminal device file that allows for user interaction with the system. Writing to this file could indicate attempts to establish a foothold or maintain persistence. Moderate likelihood of exploitation. |
