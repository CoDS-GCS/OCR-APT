# Attack Report: tc3_anomalous_subgraph_1.csv

## Summary of Attack Behavior

On April 11, 2018, at 23:01, a series of file operations were logged that indicate potential anomalous behavior consistent with an advanced persistent threat (APT) attack. The actions included opening, reading, executing, and closing various system files, which may suggest reconnaissance or exploitation activities. 

The following key events were observed:
- Multiple files were opened and closed, including system libraries and configuration files, which could indicate an attempt to gather information about the system or manipulate its behavior.
- The execution of the command `df`, which is typically used to report file system disk space usage, may suggest an attempt to gather information about available resources.
- Memory mapping (MMAP) of critical libraries indicates potential exploitation or manipulation of these files.

These actions align with the **Internal Reconnaissance** stage of the APT attack lifecycle, where the attacker seeks to understand the environment and gather information for further exploitation.

## Table of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

| IoC                  | Security Context                                                                                     |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| hpet0                | A hardware timer file; legitimate usage in system operations. Exploitation likelihood is low unless manipulated for timing attacks. |
| ld-elf.so.hints      | A configuration file for dynamic linking; legitimate usage in ELF binaries. Exploitation likelihood is moderate if altered to redirect library loading. |
| libdl.so.1          | A dynamic linking library; legitimate usage in executing programs. Exploitation likelihood is moderate if compromised to load malicious code. |
| libmap.conf          | A configuration file for library mapping; legitimate usage in system configuration. Exploitation likelihood is moderate if modified to redirect library calls. |
| libutil.so.9        | A utility library; legitimate usage in various system functions. Exploitation likelihood is moderate if altered to execute malicious functions. |
| libxo.so.0          | A library for output formatting; legitimate usage in applications. Exploitation likelihood is low unless used to manipulate output for obfuscation. |
| df                   | A standard command for disk usage; legitimate usage in system monitoring. Exploitation likelihood is low, but could be used for reconnaissance. |
