# Attack Report: tc3_anomalous_subgraph_25.csv

## Summary of Attack Behavior

The logs from the document indicate a series of file operations that suggest potential anomalous behavior. The key events occurred on April 11, 2018, and include the opening and closing of a file, as well as the forking of a process. 

1. **File Operations**: The file `tc3_anomalous_subgraph_25.csv` was opened and closed multiple times within a short time frame, which may indicate suspicious activity. 
2. **Process Forking**: The forking of a process at 23:58 could signify an attempt to create a new process that may be used for malicious purposes, such as executing additional payloads or maintaining persistence.

These actions could be indicative of the **Internal Reconnaissance** stage of an APT attack, where the attacker is gathering information and preparing for further exploitation.

## Table of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

| IoC   | Security Context                                                                                     |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CLOSE | A legitimate operation to close files. However, frequent closing of files in a short time frame may indicate suspicious behavior, especially if it coincides with other anomalous activities. |
| OPEN  | A standard operation to access files. Repeated opening of the same file in a short period can suggest an attempt to manipulate or exfiltrate data. |
| FORK  | A legitimate system operation to create a new process. However, forking processes can be exploited to run malicious code or maintain persistence, raising the likelihood of exploitation. |
