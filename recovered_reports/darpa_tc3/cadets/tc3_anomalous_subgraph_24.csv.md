# Attack Report: tc3_anomalous_subgraph_24.csv

## Summary of Attack Behavior

The logs from the document indicate a series of actions involving the file named "security" on April 11, 2018. The key events are as follows:

1. **File Operations**: At 23:01, a process closed the file "security," immediately followed by another process opening the same file. This could indicate an attempt to manipulate or access sensitive information within the file, which is a common behavior during the **Internal Reconnaissance** stage of an APT attack.

2. **Process Forking**: At 23:06, a process forked another process. This action may suggest an escalation of privileges or an attempt to establish a foothold within the system, aligning with the **Privilege Escalation** stage of an APT attack.

The sequence of these events raises concerns about potential malicious activity, particularly given the timing and nature of the file operations.

## Table of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

| IoC       | Security Context                                                                                     |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| security  | The file "security" is likely a legitimate file used for system operations. However, its manipulation (closing and opening) in quick succession raises the likelihood of exploitation, indicating potential unauthorized access or data manipulation. |
