## Summary of Attack Behavior

On April 11, 2018, at 23:06, a series of suspicious activities were logged that indicate potential malicious behavior. The process `410.pkg-audit` was closed, followed by the execution of the command `stat`, and a file write operation occurred. These actions suggest an attempt to manipulate or exfiltrate data, which aligns with the **Internal Reconnaissance** stage of an APT attack. The closing of the `410.pkg-audit` process may indicate an effort to cover tracks or prevent detection, while the execution of `stat` could be aimed at gathering information about file attributes, further supporting reconnaissance efforts.

## Table of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

| IoC              | Security Context                                                                                     |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 410.pkg-audit    | This file may be a legitimate auditing tool; however, its closure during suspicious activity raises concerns about potential exploitation or data manipulation. |
| stat             | A standard command used to display file or file system status. While legitimate, its usage in this context may indicate reconnaissance or data gathering for malicious purposes. |

## Chronological Log of Actions

| Timestamp               | Action                                      |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 2018-04-11 23:06       | A process CLOSE the file: 410.pkg-audit    |
| 2018-04-11 23:06       | A process EXECUTE the file: stat            |
| 2018-04-11 23:06       | A process WRITE a file                      | 

This report highlights the need for further investigation into the activities surrounding the identified IoCs, as they may indicate a broader malicious campaign.
