# Attack Report: tc3_anomalous_subgraph_20.csv

## Summary of Attack Behavior

The logs from the document indicate a sequence of process management events that suggest potential anomalous behavior. The key events are as follows:

1. **Process Forking**: A process was forked on **2018-04-11 at 23:05**. This action typically indicates the creation of a new process, which can be a legitimate operation but may also signify an attempt to execute malicious code or maintain persistence.

2. **File Closure**: A file was closed on **2018-04-12 at 14:55**. This could indicate the completion of a task or the end of a session, but in the context of an APT, it may also suggest an attempt to cover tracks by closing files that were accessed during the attack.

3. **Another File Closure**: The same file was closed again at **2018-04-12 at 14:55**, reinforcing the previous action and indicating a potential focus on specific files of interest.

4. **Subsequent Process Forking**: Another process was forked on **2018-04-12 at 14:55**. This simultaneous forking and file closure may indicate a coordinated effort to execute additional malicious actions while managing file access.

These events suggest a possible **Internal Reconnaissance** stage, where the attacker is exploring the system and managing processes to establish a foothold.

## Table of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

| IoC   | Security Context                                                                                     |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FORK  | The `FORK` command is used to create a new process. While legitimate in many contexts, it can be exploited to execute malicious code or maintain persistence. High likelihood of exploitation if used in conjunction with other suspicious activities. |
| CLOSE | The `CLOSE` command is used to terminate access to a file. This can be a legitimate action, but in the context of an APT, it may indicate an attempt to hide evidence of malicious activity. Moderate likelihood of exploitation, especially if occurring after suspicious file access. |
| ..    | The notation `..` typically refers to a parent directory in file paths. Its presence in logs may indicate attempts to access or manipulate files in higher directory structures, which can be a tactic used in lateral movement or data exfiltration. Moderate likelihood of exploitation. |

## Chronological Log of Actions

| Timestamp           | Action                                      |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 2018-04-11 23:05    | A process FORK a process.                  |
| 2018-04-12 14:55    | A process CLOSE a file.                    |
| 2018-04-12 14:55    | A process CLOSE the file: ..                |
| 2018-04-12 14:55    | A process FORK a process.                  |
