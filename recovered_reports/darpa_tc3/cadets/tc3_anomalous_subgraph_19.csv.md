# Attack Report: tc3_anomalous_subgraph_19.csv

## Summary of Attack Behavior

The logs indicate a series of anomalous activities occurring on April 12, 2018, primarily involving the closure of files and network flows. The sequence of events suggests a potential APT attack, particularly during the following stages:

- **Initial Compromise**: The closure of network flows may indicate an attempt to disrupt communication or exfiltrate data.
- **Covering Tracks**: The repeated closure of files and processes suggests an effort to erase traces of the attacker's presence.

Key events include:
- Multiple file closures (5 times at 14:36, 10 times at 14:37, and 5 times at 14:38).
- Closure of two distinct network flows (128.55.12.67 at 14:36 and 128.55.12.10 at 14:37).
- The exit of a process at 14:38, which may indicate the conclusion of the attack or an attempt to evade detection.

## Table of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

| IoC              | Security Context                                                                                     |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 128.55.12.67     | This external IP address may be associated with malicious activity. Legitimate usage could include normal network traffic, but its involvement in the closure of a flow raises suspicion of exploitation. |
| 128.55.12.10     | Similar to the above, this IP address could represent a legitimate service. However, its closure during the incident suggests potential exploitation or unauthorized access. |
