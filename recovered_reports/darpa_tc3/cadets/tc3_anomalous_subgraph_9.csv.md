# Attack Report: Anomaly Detection in tc3_anomalous_subgraph_9.csv

## Summary of Attack Behavior

On April 11, 2018, at 23:06, a series of suspicious activities were logged, indicating potential malicious behavior. The process executed the file `tee`, which is commonly used for redirecting output to files, suggesting an attempt to capture or manipulate data. Following this, the same process was observed to flow to a file, indicating a possible data exfiltration or manipulation attempt. The process also read from a file, which could imply reconnaissance or data gathering. Finally, the process wrote to a file named `periodic.Gu2SGveu5C`, which raises concerns as it may be indicative of an attempt to create or modify a potentially malicious file.

These actions suggest that the attack may be in the **Data Exfiltration** stage of the APT lifecycle, where the attacker is attempting to gather and possibly exfiltrate sensitive information.

## Table of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

| IoC                     | Security Context                                                                                     |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| periodic.Gu2SGveu5C    | This file name appears suspicious and may indicate a malicious payload. Legitimate usage is rare, and its presence raises the likelihood of exploitation. |
