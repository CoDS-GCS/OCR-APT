# Comprehensive Attack Report

## Summary of Attack Behavior

The analysis of the provided reports indicates a sophisticated Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) operation characterized by multiple stages, including Initial Compromise, Internal Reconnaissance, Command and Control, Data Exfiltration, and attempts to Cover Tracks. The logs reveal a series of suspicious activities involving the execution of legitimate commands and processes, which were likely exploited for malicious purposes.

### Key Events and Stages:

1. **Initial Compromise**: 
   - The execution of the `lsof` command and access to system files such as `gather_stats_uma.txt` suggest an initial reconnaissance phase where the attacker assessed the environment. The presence of external IP addresses, particularly **128.55.12.10**, indicates potential command and control communication.

2. **Internal Reconnaissance**: 
   - Frequent access to sensitive system files like `kmem`, `services`, and `kernel_zones.txt` indicates that the attacker was gathering information about the system's memory and services. The use of processes such as `vmstat` and libraries like `libkvm.so.7` and `libmemstat.so.3` further supports this stage.

3. **Command and Control**: 
   - The establishment of communication with external IP addresses, notably **192.113.144.28**, suggests that the attacker was maintaining a command and control channel. The execution of `libpcap.so.8` for packet capturing raises concerns about data interception and manipulation.

4. **Data Exfiltration**: 
   - The repeated writing to files like `gather_stats_uma.txt` and the presence of multiple external IP addresses indicate potential data collection and exfiltration activities. The logs suggest that the attacker was methodically gathering sensitive information for unauthorized access.

5. **Covering Tracks**: 
   - The manipulation of system files and processes, along with the execution of commands to hide the attacker's presence, indicates attempts to cover tracks. The use of temporary files and frequent access to system libraries suggests a deliberate effort to evade detection.

## Table of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

| IoC                     | Security Context                                                                                     |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 128.55.12.10           | External IP address potentially used for command and control. High likelihood of exploitation.     |
| 128.55.12.55           | Another external IP address associated with suspicious activity. Requires further investigation.    |
| 128.55.12.67           | External IP address that may be linked to malicious activity.                                       |
| 128.55.12.1            | External IP address that requires further analysis for potential links to the attack.              |
| 128.55.12.110          | External IP address involved in suspicious activities.                                             |
| 128.55.12.141          | External IP address that may be part of the attacker's infrastructure.                             |
| lsof                    | A legitimate command for listing open files; its usage in this context raises suspicion.           |
| gather_stats_uma.txt   | A file that may be used for data collection; frequent writes suggest potential data exfiltration. |
| kernel_zones.txt       | A system file that may contain sensitive kernel memory information.                                 |
| libkvm.so.7            | A shared library used for kernel memory access; its exploitation can lead to unauthorized access.  |
| libmemstat.so.3        | A library for memory statistics; can be misused to gather sensitive memory information.            |
| vmstat                  | A legitimate system monitoring tool; its execution in a suspicious context raises red flags.       |
| libpcap.so.8           | A legitimate library for packet capturing; its usage raises suspicion of exploitation.              |
| kmem                    | A memory file that can provide sensitive information; its access indicates potential exploitation.  |
| services                | A system file that lists active services; frequent access suggests reconnaissance.                  |
| .lsof_ta1-cadets       | A temporary file likely used for logging; its access pattern indicates potential malicious activity. |
| top_procs.txt          | A file that may log active processes; its access could indicate monitoring of system activity.      |

## Chronological Log of Actions

### April 11, 2018
- **16:37**: Execution of `ifconfig`, multiple shared libraries opened and memory-mapped.
- **21:37**: Execution of `vmstat`, access to `kernel_zones.txt`, and multiple library interactions.

### April 12, 2018
- **09:40**: Execution of `vmstat`, access to `kernel_mem.txt`, and similar library interactions as the previous day.
- **14:35**: Initiation of communication with external IP **192.113.144.28**, execution of `libpcap.so.8`, and multiple data exchanges logged.
- **14:36 - 14:38**: Ongoing data exchange with external IP, indicating potential data exfiltration or command execution.

## Conclusion

The logs reflect a structured approach to establishing a foothold, conducting reconnaissance, and communicating with external entities, characteristic of APT behavior. The presence of multiple IoCs and suspicious activities warrants further investigation to assess the impact and scope of the activities. Immediate actions should be taken to mitigate any ongoing threats and secure the affected systems.
