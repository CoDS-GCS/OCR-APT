# Attack Report: tc3_anomalous_subgraph_6.csv

## Summary of Attack Behavior

The logs from the document indicate a series of suspicious activities occurring on April 11, 2018, at 23:06. The key events include the execution of a file named "ipfw," which is a legitimate firewall management tool, but its usage in this context raises concerns about potential exploitation. Additionally, there are multiple actions involving files labeled as "null," which may indicate attempts to manipulate or access files without proper identification, suggesting possible evasion tactics. The presence of the "500.ipfwdenied" file indicates that there were denied access attempts, which could be part of an initial compromise or reconnaissance phase. Overall, these actions suggest a potential APT attack in the **Initial Compromise** and **Internal Reconnaissance** stages.

## Table of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

| IoC                | Security Context                                                                                     |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 500.ipfwdenied     | This file indicates a denied access attempt, which may suggest unauthorized access attempts or misconfigurations. High likelihood of exploitation if associated with malicious intent. |
| ipfw               | A legitimate firewall management tool. However, its execution in this context raises concerns about potential misuse or exploitation. Moderate likelihood of exploitation if used maliciously. |
| null               | Represents an unidentified file or process. Its repeated appearance may indicate attempts to obfuscate actions or manipulate the system. High likelihood of exploitation due to its ambiguous nature. |
