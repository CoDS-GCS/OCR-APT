# Attack Report: tc3_anomalous_subgraph_18.csv

## Summary of Attack Behavior

The logs from the document indicate a series of suspicious activities occurring on April 12, 2018, primarily focused on closing files and network flows. The sequence of events suggests a potential APT attack, characterized by systematic actions that may indicate reconnaissance and data exfiltration efforts.

1. **Initial Compromise**: The logs do not explicitly indicate the initial compromise, but the subsequent actions suggest that the attacker may have gained access to the system.
   
2. **Internal Reconnaissance**: The frequent closing of files and network flows indicates that the attacker was likely gathering information about the system and its network connections.

3. **Command and Control**: The closing of multiple network flows could suggest attempts to establish or maintain command and control over the compromised system.

4. **Covering Tracks**: The repeated closing of files and network connections may also indicate efforts to erase traces of the attacker's presence.

The timestamps indicate a concentrated effort over a short period, with multiple actions occurring within minutes, suggesting a well-coordinated attack.

## Table of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

| IoC                | Security Context                                                                                     |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 128.55.12.67       | An external IP address that may be associated with malicious activity. Legitimate usage is possible, but exploitation likelihood is moderate to high. |
| 128.55.12.1        | Another external IP address that could indicate a command and control server. Legitimate usage is low, with high exploitation likelihood. |
| 128.55.12.110      | This IP may be involved in data exfiltration or lateral movement. Legitimate usage is low, with high exploitation likelihood. |
| 128.55.12.10       | Potentially a malicious external connection. Legitimate usage is low, with high exploitation likelihood. |
| 128.55.12.141      | This IP could be part of a botnet or used for unauthorized access. Legitimate usage is low, with high exploitation likelihood. |
| 128.55.12.55       | An external IP that may indicate suspicious activity. Legitimate usage is low, with high exploitation likelihood. |
