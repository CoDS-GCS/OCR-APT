# Attack Report: context_file_r2te1030

## Summary of Attack Behavior

The logs from the document indicate a coordinated attack involving multiple processes, primarily targeting the creation, modification, and deletion of files associated with the identifier `r2te1030`. The attack appears to have been executed in a systematic manner, with various processes performing overlapping actions, suggesting a well-planned operation.

### Key Events:
- **Initial Compromise**: Multiple processes, including `lsass.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `GoogleUpdate.exe`, created files associated with `r2te1030` at the same timestamp (2019-09-23 12:58). This simultaneous activity indicates a potential initial compromise where multiple vectors were utilized to establish a foothold.
  
- **Internal Reconnaissance**: The same processes engaged in reading and writing to the files, suggesting they were gathering information about the system and potentially preparing for further actions.

- **Maintain Persistence**: The processes `GoogleUpdate.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `taskhostw.exe` were involved in creating files that could be used for persistence, indicating an effort to maintain access to the compromised system.

- **Covering Tracks**: A significant number of delete actions were recorded across various processes, including `taskhostw.exe`, `wmiprvse.exe`, and `Explorer.EXE`. This behavior is indicative of an attempt to erase traces of the attack, a common tactic in APT operations.

|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `lsass.exe`         | A legitimate Windows process responsible for handling security policies. High likelihood of exploitation if misused. |
| `powershell.exe`    | A powerful scripting language often used for automation. Can be exploited for malicious scripts.   |
| `svchost.exe`       | A generic host process for services that run from dynamic-link libraries. Can be exploited for persistence. |
| `taskhostw.exe`     | A process that hosts multiple Windows services. Can be used for malicious purposes if compromised.  |
| `wmiprvse.exe`      | A WMI provider host process. Can be exploited for remote management and data exfiltration.          |
| `Explorer.EXE`      | The Windows file manager. Can be exploited to execute malicious files or scripts.                   |
| `GoogleUpdate.exe`  | A legitimate process for updating Google software. Can be exploited to maintain persistence.        |
| `SearchProtocolHost.exe` | A process related to Windows Search. Can be exploited for data collection or exfiltration.      |
