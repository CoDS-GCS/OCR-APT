# Attack Report: Context File SVCHOST

## Summary of Attack Behavior

The logs from the context_file_svchost document indicate a series of actions primarily involving the `svchost.exe` process and its associated prefetch files. The activity spans from 10:30 AM to 4:28 PM on September 24, 2019. 

### Key Events:
- **Initial Compromise**: The presence of multiple reads of `SVCHOST.EXE-CA1952BB.pf`, `SVCHOST.EXE-2562231B.pf`, and `SVCHOST.EXE-824A39CF.pf` suggests that the attacker may have initially compromised the system by executing or leveraging these files.
- **Internal Reconnaissance**: The repeated access to `svchost.exe` and its associated files indicates an attempt to gather information about the system and its services.
- **Command and Control**: No direct indicators of command and control were observed in the logs.
- **Privilege Escalation**: No specific actions indicating privilege escalation were recorded.
- **Lateral Movement**: No evidence of lateral movement was detected in the logs.
- **Maintain Persistence**: The continuous access to `svchost.exe` suggests an attempt to maintain persistence on the system.
- **Data Exfiltration**: No signs of data exfiltration were found in the logs.
- **Covering Tracks**: No actions indicating covering tracks were observed.

Overall, the logs suggest a focus on maintaining persistence and internal reconnaissance, with no clear indicators of data exfiltration or command and control.

## Table of IoCs Detected

| IoC                          | Security Context                                                                                     |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| svchost.exe                  | A legitimate Windows process responsible for managing system services. High likelihood of exploitation if misused. |
| SVCHOST.EXE-CA1952BB.pf      | A prefetch file associated with `svchost.exe`. Could indicate execution of malicious code if accessed by unauthorized processes. |
| SVCHOST.EXE-2562231B.pf      | Another prefetch file for `svchost.exe`. Similar risks as above, indicating potential malicious activity. |
| SVCHOST.EXE-824A39CF.pf      | A prefetch file that may indicate the execution of a service or application. Requires further investigation if accessed by suspicious processes. |
