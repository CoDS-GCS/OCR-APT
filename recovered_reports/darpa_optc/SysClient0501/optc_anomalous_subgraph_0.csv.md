# Attack Report: Anomalous Activity Detected in optc_anomalous_subgraph_0.csv

## Summary of Attack Behavior

The logs from the document indicate a series of suspicious activities primarily involving the `svchost.exe` process, which is commonly used by Windows to host services. The events span from 11:32 to 12:00 on September 24, 2019, and exhibit behaviors consistent with an advanced persistent threat (APT) attack. 

Key events include:

- **Command Execution**: Multiple instances of shell commands being executed (up to 15 times in a single minute), indicating potential exploitation or malicious activity.
- **Inbound and Outbound Messaging**: Repeated inbound messages from the IP address `142.20.57.246` and outbound messages to `202.6.172.98`, suggesting a command and control (C2) communication channel.
- **File Manipulation**: The creation and deletion of PowerShell script files, which are often used in APTs for executing commands and maintaining persistence.
- **Module Loading**: The loading of various system modules, which could indicate attempts to exploit system vulnerabilities or execute malicious payloads.

These behaviors suggest that the attack is primarily in the **Command and Control** stage, with elements of **Initial Compromise** and **Privilege Escalation**.

## Table of IoCs Detected

| IoC                                   | Security Context                                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `202.6.172.98`                        | An external IP address frequently used for C2 communications. High likelihood of exploitation.      |
| `142.20.57.246`                       | Another external IP address involved in inbound communications. Potentially malicious.               |
| `svchost.exe`                         | A legitimate Windows process that can be exploited for malicious purposes. Moderate to high risk.   |
| `Microsoft.Powershell.Commands.Diagnostics.ni.dll` | A legitimate PowerShell module that can be used for system diagnostics but may be exploited for malicious scripting. |
| `Microsoft.WSMan.Management.ni.dll`   | A legitimate module for managing Windows systems remotely, which can be abused for unauthorized access. |
