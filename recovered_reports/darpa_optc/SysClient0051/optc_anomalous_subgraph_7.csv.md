# Attack Report: Anomalous Activity Detected

## Summary of Attack Behavior

On September 25, 2019, at 09:18, the process `services.exe` exhibited suspicious behavior indicative of potential malicious activity. The process performed two significant actions: it added a registry entry and opened an inbound flow. These actions suggest an attempt to establish persistence and potentially facilitate command and control communication, which aligns with the **Privilege Escalation** and **Command and Control** stages of an APT attack. The addition of a registry entry could indicate an effort to maintain persistence on the compromised system, while opening an inbound flow may suggest an attempt to allow external access to the system.

## Table of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

| IoC            | Security Context                                                                                     |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| services.exe   | A legitimate Windows process responsible for managing services. However, its exploitation likelihood is moderate to high, as it can be manipulated by attackers to execute malicious commands or maintain persistence. |

## Chronological Log of Actions

| Timestamp               | Action Description                                      |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 2019-09-25 09:18       | `services.exe` ADD a registry.                        |
| 2019-09-25 09:18       | `services.exe` OPEN_INBOUND a flow.                   |

This report highlights the need for further investigation into the `services.exe` process and the associated registry changes to determine the extent of the compromise and to mitigate potential threats.
