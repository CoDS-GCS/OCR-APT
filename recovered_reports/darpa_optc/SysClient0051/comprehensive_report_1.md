# Comprehensive Attack Report

## Summary of Attack Behavior

The analysis of the provided reports indicates a coordinated attack involving multiple stages of an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) on September 25, 2019. The attack primarily utilized the `python.exe` and `svchost.exe` processes to execute malicious activities, including data exfiltration, internal reconnaissance, and potential command and control communications. The presence of various suspicious files and external IP addresses suggests a well-planned operation aimed at compromising sensitive information and maintaining persistence within the target environment.

### Key Events:
- **Initial Compromise**: The attack began with the execution of `python.exe`, which was used to load various Python modules and libraries, indicating a setup phase for exploitation. The presence of files such as `node_id.txt` and `ncr.key` suggests that the attacker was gathering sensitive information for further exploitation. Additionally, the presence of multiple executables, including `biguwcmnsucig.exe`, indicates that the system may have been initially compromised through a malicious payload or exploit.

- **Internal Reconnaissance**: The logs show extensive file reading activities, including multiple `.pyc` files and configuration files, indicating that the attacker was exploring the environment to identify potential targets and vulnerabilities. The use of commands via `cmd.exe`, `wmiprvse.exe`, and other system processes suggests that the attacker was gathering information about the system and its environment.

- **Command and Control**: Outbound connections were established to external IP addresses, notably `142.20.61.132`, `10.20.2.66`, and `53.192.68.50`, which are suspected command and control servers. The repeated communication with these addresses suggests attempts to receive commands or exfiltrate data. The consistent outbound connections to `53.192.68.50`, particularly from processes like `biguwcmnsucig.exe` and `GoogleUpdate.exe`, indicate that the attacker was likely maintaining a command and control channel to execute further commands or exfiltrate data.

- **Data Exfiltration**: The attack involved multiple outbound messages to external IPs, indicating potential data exfiltration attempts. The use of libraries related to PDF generation (e.g., `pdfgen`, `pdfutils.pyc`, `pdfmetrics.pyc`) may suggest that the attacker was preparing to create or manipulate documents for phishing or data theft.

- **Maintain Persistence**: The repeated execution of `biguwcmnsucig.exe` and `GoogleUpdate.exe` suggests that the attacker was attempting to maintain persistence on the compromised system.

- **Covering Tracks**: Although no specific indicators were identified for covering tracks, the use of legitimate processes and libraries could indicate an attempt to blend in with normal operations to avoid detection.
