# Attack Report

## Summary of Attack Behavior

The logs from the `context_ckfgw` document indicate a series of suspicious activities primarily involving the IP address `239.255.255.250`, which is a multicast address often associated with network discovery protocols. The logs show multiple instances of inbound messages and flows, suggesting potential reconnaissance and command and control (C2) activities.

### Key Events:
- **Initial Compromise**: The presence of executable files such as `pagefile.sys`, `SVCHOST.EXE-135A30D8.pf`, and `SSDPSRV.DLL` indicates potential exploitation of system vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
- **Internal Reconnaissance**: The repeated inbound messages from `239.255.255.250` suggest that the attacker is gathering information about the network environment.
- **Command and Control**: The consistent communication with the multicast address indicates a possible C2 channel being established for further instructions or data exfiltration.

The logs do not show evidence of privilege escalation, lateral movement, maintaining persistence, data exfiltration, or covering tracks, indicating that the attack may still be in the reconnaissance or initial exploitation phase.

## Table of IoCs Detected

| IoC                             | Security Context                                                                                     |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `239.255.255.250`              | A multicast address used for network discovery; legitimate in certain contexts but often exploited for reconnaissance. |
| `pagefile.sys`                  | A system file used for virtual memory; could be exploited if manipulated or accessed by malicious processes. |
| `SVCHOST.EXE-135A30D8.pf`      | A prefetch file associated with a legitimate Windows process; could indicate exploitation if linked to malicious activity. |
| `SSDPSRV.DLL`                   | A legitimate Windows DLL for SSDP services; could be exploited if a malicious version is injected or if it is misused. |
